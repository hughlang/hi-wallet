# Welcome to Hi Wallet

This is my Hello World app. I am a new Rust developer, but I also have decades of experience as a software developer. More specifically, I have skills in UI development in a number of languages and platforms, including: IOS/Swift/Objective-C, HTML/Javascript/CSS, Android (some), and Flash/Actionscript. As a new Rust dev, I have ramped up on the language syntax and I am diving head first into the pool with this project. 

This project aims to create a crypto wallet prototype that runs as a native app on all major desktop operating systems and eventually mobile. In this experiment, we will utilize the OrbTk project from the Redox OS team, which is working on an operating system built with Rust. I researched and experimented with many of the alternatives (Yew, Azul, Conrod) and found that OrbTk fits my needs better. Less C++ and proprietary dependencies like Qt and Gtk. 

As a start, this repo will focus on building on more widgets for OrbTk. 

## Widgets 

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
